# openCV-tesseract-faceDetection
Fusion of openCV, Pillow and Tesseract.

Extract the given zipped files containing newspaper clippings. Then search for specific string and detect faces on the page where string was found using openCV and handle exception too.
Now nicely display faces detected in a contact_sheet prepared using pillow(python Imaging Library).
It was fun doing this.
