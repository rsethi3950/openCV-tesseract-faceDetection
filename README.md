# openCV-tesseract-faceDetection
Fusion of openCV, Pillow and Tesseract.

You were given zipped files and extract them. Then search for specific string and detect faces on the page where string was found and handle exception too.
Now nicely display faces detected in a contact_sheet prepared using pillow.
It was fun doing this.

You can download zipped files from link given below:
